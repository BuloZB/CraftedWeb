The TODO List for Crafted Web ->

-Definatly first of all, a way more stylish admin panel.
Current one is WAY too basic/simple.

-Different layout for player account panels that shows all 
tools instead of in sections (Maybe a "profile" type of style

-Maybe tweak the install script a bit more.

-Update the vote shop & donation shop, fix some bugs that dont
give items/vote points

-A more elaborate realm status panel (like molten-wow.com's)

-An incorporated PHPBB forums that comes with the CMS and shares the account login.

-An Armory page

-An Online Auction House

-Split the main content into 3 sections instead of 2, so we can add leftside panels.

-Shout box on the left side panel(enable/disable options on ALL panels)

-Still thinking....................................
